# DAT158_Prosjekt

For the final project work, your task is to make a complete, machine learning-based software product. You are free to choose the project idea, and which ML and web frameworks you want to use to deploy your model. Make sure, however, that you follow the instructions listed below. If need some assistance in defining a good project, come ask us at the lab or send a message on Canvas.

The goal of the project is to create an ML-based software in form of a website, that solves some kind of useful, cool, and/or fun task.

There are two directions you can follow:

Create a model from bottom up, following the steps of the ML project lifecycle we have discussed in lectures. This way you will have control of all steps and can tailor your model to be the optimal solution to the task you are trying to solve.
Build your project on top of existing ML products, such as the large language model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT. If you want to build a chatbot or an image generation tool, it is far beyond the scope of the course to train this type of model from scratch -- which is also the case for most businesses. In this case we have to build the project around the API of a pre-made model.
Remember that if you go for this approach, you still need to adapt the solution to your use-case (you can't just make a generic ChatGPT clone).
 
Instructions
You should work in groups of 2-3 students.
You are allowed to use AI coding tools and take inspiration from solutions you find on the Internet, but you need to cite sources you use. Plagiarism is, as always, strictly forbidden.
You must write a short report documenting your work, following this template: Norwegian, English. It's a good idea to start writing as soon as you have a plan for the project, as this helps you focus. You can upload the template to Google Docs for easier collaborative writing.
The code you write, the report, and everything related to the project, must be put in a GitHub repository. You project submission here on Canvas will be a link to the repository. The repository has to be readable my me, so in case you want to set it as "private", you need to invite me (smaeland) as a collaborator.
The final product must be a website that takes in user input, and gives a ML-based result in return. There are two ways to show how the website works: Either
Deploy it publicly on the Internet (the preferred option -- some hosting options listed below), or
Make a video/screencast of you interacting with it.
The code and documentation in the GitHub repository must be complete, meaning anyone should be able to reproduce your results and deploy the website.

How to submit
Submit a link to the GitHub repository containing the group's work. Everyone must individually submit on Canvas, but within a group you just submit the same link.

Submission checklist:
The group's GitHub repo contains

The report
All code required to reproduce your results
Documentation of you final website, either as
Link to the live website
Video of you showing the features of the website
How much work is expected?
There is no lower limit on the number of lines of code you are supposed to produce, since a big part of the project is to invent the idea, research the topic, and then plan and design the solution. The report should convey how much effort you spent on this part. You can expect to spend around a week of fulltime work to compete the project.
